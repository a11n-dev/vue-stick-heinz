It cannot, however, work as a sentence by          itself. Example: Raghav dances only when Bhavya sings. Here, ‘Raghav          dances’ is the independent clause and ‘only when Bhavya sings’ is          the dependent clause. This is because the subordinate clause makes          no sense on its own. It is “subordinate” because it “depends” on the          main clause to make sense. This can further be clarified, by writing          the two ‘sentences’ separately: Raghav dances.
